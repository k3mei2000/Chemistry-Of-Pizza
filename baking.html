					<h2>Magic of Pizza</h2>
					<h3>Fermentation by Yeast</h3>
					<p>When making the pizza dough, the “magic” is when the dough rises.
					To do so, the main reaction is the <strong>fermentation of glucose</strong> via 
					the <strong>baking yeast</strong>. To understand this reaction, similar reactions 
					must be analyzed. Although all three reactions involve the 
					breakdown, or fermentation, of the sugar glucose, a difference 
					can be seen in the products, where the third reaction, 
					fermentation by yeast, only has the products of ethanol and 
					carbon dioxide. In this reaction, it can be seen that the 
					formation of carbon dioxide, a byproduct, is the reason why the 
					pizza dough rises; <strong>when gaseous carbon dioxide is formed, it 
					creates pockets of air that pushes the dough to rise.</strong>

					<p>Another major difference is that the top two reactions occur 
					relatively quickly at a rate of  once per second. However, the third
					reaction takes the longest—<strong>once every hour</strong>. Here, the shorter reaction
					times of the top two fermentation processes are more <strong>“efficient”</strong>, meaning
					that there is less time for a mistake to occur. Yet, in the third reaction, 
					the higher chance of <strong>“mess-ups”</strong> has a surprising advantage. These “mess-ups”,
					or side reactions,  lead to <strong>new flavor molecules</strong> that enhance the taste of 
					the dough. As a result, the <strong>recommended time</strong> to develop the dough is <strong>one 
					to two days</strong>. In this way, more flavor molecules can form from the “mess-ups” 
					of the third reaction.
					</p>
					<h3>The Maillard Reaction and Caramelization</h3>
					<p>While the <strong>fermentation by yeast</strong> contributes to the light, fluffy, and 
					flavorful pizza dough essential to any pizza, another reaction creates the
					crust and browned cheese that comprises the identity of pizza itself: a 
					non-enzymatic process called the <strong>Maillard reaction</strong>. Named after the 19th 
					century chemist <strong>Louis Camille Maillard</strong> who first observed the phenomenon, 
					the Maillard reaction is when various foods form a golden-brown crust. 
					More specifically, the Maillard reaction only occurs at <strong>high temperatures</strong>, 
					around <strong>140-165 °C</strong>, and it is when <strong>amino acids</strong>, or <strong>proteins</strong>, react with 
					<strong>reducing sugars</strong> to produce a <strong>browning effect</strong> and to cultivate delicious 
					flavors and aromas. In other words, the “magic” of the Maillard reaction 
					occurs when the pizza is being baked.

					<p>When looking at the Maillard reaction of pizza crust, <strong>sugars</strong> and <strong>amino 
					acids</strong> are involved in three steps. Common sugars involved include glucose, 
					sucrose, lactose, and maltose, and examples of amino acids involved include 
					lysine, alanine, and proline. In the first step, sugars and amino acids start
					to <strong>condensate</strong>, or form a liquid at the high temperature. This stage is 
					colorless, and is undetectable to the human eye. Second, both the sugars and
					amino acids begin to <strong>break down</strong>, wherein the sugars dehydrate and amino acids
					degrade. Here, a visible change can be seen, where the crust begins to turn 
					light yellow. Third, the amino acids and sugars react, resulting in the
					<strong>polymerization of aldehyde-amine compounds</strong> and the <strong>creation of nitrogen compounds</strong>.
					In this stage the golden-brown crust is achieved, along with a myriad of 
					savory flavors and aromas.

					<p class="description">Example: Polymerization of Aldehyde-amine Compounds</p>
					<p>In terms of the browning of cheese, a similar process occurs mainly through 
					the <strong>Maillard reaction</strong> and also via a <strong>subsidiary caramelization reaction</strong>. Once again,
					with the Maillard reaction, sugars and amino acids rearrange to form a crust that 
					reflects brown light—hence the golden-brown color visible to the human eye. Although
					less prominent, the <strong>non-enzymatic process of caramelization</strong> also occurs. Here, the 
					high heat breaks sugar molecules apart, but this time, there is no interaction with
					amino acids. Rather, the <strong>oxidation of sugars</strong> contributes to the <strong>brown crust</strong>, and also
					produces its own host of sweet, nutty, and toasty flavors and aromas.
