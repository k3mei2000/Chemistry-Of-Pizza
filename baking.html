					<h2>Magic of Pizza</h2>
					<h3>Fermentation by Yeast</h3>
					<p>When making the pizza dough, the “magic” is when the dough rises. To do so, the main reaction is the fermentation of glucose via the baking yeast. To understand this reaction, similar reactions must be analyzed. Although all three reactions involve the breakdown, or fermentation, of the sugar glucose, a difference can be seen in the products, where the third reaction, fermentation by yeast, only has the products of ethanol and carbon dioxide. In this reaction, it can be seen that the formation of carbon dioxide, a byproduct, is the reason why the pizza dough rises; when gaseous carbon dioxide is formed, it creates pockets of air that pushes the dough to rise.
