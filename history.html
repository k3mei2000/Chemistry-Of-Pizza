					<p class="description">Classic Pepperoni Pizza</p>
					<p>With a name roughly translated from the Italian “flat pie”, 
					pizza originated in the Mediterranean and has been around for 
					thousands of years. Pizza began as a staple reserved for the 
					Neapolitan poor, known as <em>lazzaroni</em>, and was made with the 
					cheapest ingredients found in the slums: <strong>flour</strong>, <strong>olive oil</strong>, 
					<strong>lard</strong>, <strong>herbs</strong>, and <strong>cheese</strong>. As a result, Italian authors of the 
					time treated such concoctions with disdain. 
					</p>
					<p>The reputability of pizza grew when Queen Maria Carolina 
					successfully persuaded her husband, King Ferdinand IV, to have
					pizza made in the royal ovens. Suddenly, pizzas were no longer 
					associated with the poor, and <em>pizzaiolos</em>, aka pizza chefs, were
					treated with the respect given to sushi chefs in modern day. 
					Later, legend says that the established <em>pizzaiolo</em> Raffael 
					Esposito once received a royal command from Queen Margherita to
					create pizzas for a feast. One pizza Queen Margherita enjoyed 
					was the pizza mozzarella, a pie modeled after the Italian flag.
					With <strong>tomatoes</strong>, <strong>basil</strong>, and <strong>mozzarella cheese</strong> representing the 
					red, green, and white sections of the flag, the pizza was coined
					the <strong>Margherita</strong>, a popular form of pizza found today.

					<p>Pizza soon spread across the Atlantic and made its way to the US
					through the travel of Italian immigrants.The first documented 
					American pizzeria, coined Lombardi’s, opened its doors in 
					Manhattan in 1905, increasing the popularity of pizza even more. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
					<strong>⅛ of the American population is eating pizza on any given day.</strong> Presently, many variations of pizza exist,
					including calzones, torta rustica, and deep-dish pizza. 
					Regardless of shape or form, pizza cannot be made without the help of <strong>chemistry</strong>, where its various ingredients interact in reactions to create this popular staple.
